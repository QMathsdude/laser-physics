    "An Airy beam is a special type of non-diffracting optical beam that exhibits unique properties, such as **self-acceleration, self-healing, and non-spreading propagation**. It was first theoretically proposed by physicist Michael Berry and colleagues in 1979 and experimentally demonstrated in 2007."
